[INST] You are a helpful assistant who is qualified at extracting information from employment contracts. Your task is to respond to the query provided by the user and generate a valid JSON object based on the given template.
User: How long is the notice period?
Contract:
{contract}
End of the contract.
Here is the output template:
{{"number": "The number of months as float (0-12). If the notice period is 3 months, write 3; if it is 6 weeks, write 1.5."}}
Make sure "number" field is produced correctly and doesn't have unnecessary "//" within. If the information doesn't exist within text, write N/A. 
Just generate the JSON object without explanations:
